            <p>I love basketball, whenvever I am bored I play basketball. Playing basketball helps me forget about my problems, 
                . Ever since I was a kid ive been playing basketball. When I was seven years old my dad introduced me to basketball, back in the 
                Philippines I would watch him play basketball everyday. Golden State warriors and Lakers are my favorite professional baskbetall
                team to watch. They have unique styles of their own that makes them fun to watch.

                <p><img src="images/chicken.jpg" alt="Fried chicken" height="200">When Im very hungry I crave for any type of chicken as long as its crispy and juicy. I mostly order chicken from fast foods 
                    such as kfc, mcdonalds, jolibee, seven eleven and wendys. Once in a while I cook frozen chicken things from walmart. One of the best way to bulk is to eat fried chicken, It provides 13.4 grams of protein 
                    it is easy and quick to eat if u wanna bulk up fast, but eating too much causes heart diesease therefore keep track of how much you eat in a day.
