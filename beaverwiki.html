            <div class="col-container">
                <p>
                    Beavers (Castor canadensis) are herbivorous mammals that can be found in Canada. They are the second largest rodents in the world, behind the capybara. They live semi-aquatic lives and are mostly active at night.

                    Beavers are born with their very own engineering degree, instinctually able to build the stable and sturdy wooden dams they are known for. The largest beaver dam in the world can even be seen from space. Just the sound of running water is enough to send them into a building frenzy.

                <p id="para1">
                Beavers are located in the forested regions of Canada, occupying slow-flowing streams. These streams are where they construct their dams out wood, mud, and debris. The average beaver dam can be 10m to 100m, the largest dam being 850m which was discovered in Wood Buffalo National Park via satellite.

                <h3 id="head2">Why Beavers are important</h3>
                <p id="para2">
                Beavers are known as a keystone species. Without their dams, streams could flow unchecked throughout Canada. By holding back water and felling trees for their dams, beavers open up dense woods, allowing more opportunities for animals and plants.
