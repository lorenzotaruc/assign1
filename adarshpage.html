                <h2>What are the Northern Lights?</h2>
            </header>
            <p><img src="./images/aurora.jpg" height="200" alt="Northern Lights Image">The Northern Lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, are natural light displays in the Earth's sky, primarily seen in 
            high-latitude regions around the Arctic.
            A northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis),[c] is a natural light display in Earth's sky, 
            predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant
             lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.[3]

            Auroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from 
            enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the 
            trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate 
            into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit 
            light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also
             dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.
            
            Most of the planets in the Solar System, some natural satellites, brown dwarfs, and even comets also host auroras.</p>

             <h2>Where and When Can You See Them?</h2>
           </header>  
           <p>The Northern Lights are commonly visible in regions such as Canada, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, particularly between September and March.
            Auroras are most commonly observed in the "auroral zone",[8] a band approximately 6° (~660 km) wide in latitude centered on 67° north and 
            south.[9] The region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval". The oval is displaced by the solar wind, pushing it
            about 15° away from the geomagnetic pole (not the geographic pole) in the noon direction and 23° away in the midnight direction.[9] The 
            peak equatorward extent of the oval is displaced slightly from geographic midnight. It is centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic 
            pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun, 
            which is called magnetic midnight.

            Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860),[10] and later Hermann Fritz 
            (1881)[11] and Sophus Tromholt (1881)[12] in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone.

            In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the 
            southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.[13]
            The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, the Southern Cone, South Africa, Australasia and under exceptional 
            circumstances as far north as Uruguay.[14] The aurora borealis is visible from areas around the Arctic such as Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, 
            the Faroe Islands, Scandinavia, Finland, Scotland, and Russia. A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, bringing 
            the aurora to lower latitudes. On rare occasions, the aurora borealis can be seen as far south as the Mediterranean and the southern states of 
            the US. During the Carrington Event, the greatest geomagnetic storm ever observed, auroras were seen even in the tropics.

            Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead. From farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, 
            or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either 
            diffuse patches or arcs,[15] which can be subvisual.
            Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval.
            Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.
            [16][17] An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and 
            perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the "pitch angle" of the particle. 
            The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases 
            as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles
            to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other 
            particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes. Other types of 
            auroras have been observed from space; for example, "poleward arcs" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related 
            "theta aurora",[18] and "dayside arcs" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting 
            effects occur such as pulsating aurora, "black aurora" and their rarer companion "anti-black aurora" and subvisual red arcs.
            In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the 
            ones that close through Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.

            <h2>The Science Behind the Northern Lights</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Northern Lights occur when charged particles from the sun interact with the Earth's magnetic field, causing a stunning display of colors.
            A full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves 
            the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different 
            magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            A quiescent solar wind flowing past Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly 
            onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere and provide diffusion through 
            the bow shock. It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are 
            lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions, new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes 
            depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very 
            weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic") 
            and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each 
            leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere. Such replacement of 
            "hot" electrons by "cold" ones is in complete accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The complete process, which also generates 
            an electric ring current around Earth, is uncertain.
            Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' 
            tend to occur after prolonged spells (on the order of hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable 
            southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar 
            wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to 
            the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some 
            tail plasma can separate ("magnetic reconnection"); some blobs ("plasmoids") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar 
            wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). 
            A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing 
            enhancement of the "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces 
            auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.

            Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, 
            which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises 
            the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased and increases the 
            chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater 
            geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energizing processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration 
            provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.

            An animation created using the same satellite data is also available.
            The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar 
            wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically trapped particles confined 
            by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.[49]

        <h2>Cultural Significance of Northern Lights</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In many cultures, the Northern Lights have been regarded as spiritual or mystical phenomena, with various myths and stories associated 
            with them.
            The earliest datable record of an aurora was recorded in the Bamboo Annals, a historical chronicle of the history of ancient China, 
            in 977 or 957 BC.[81] An aurora was described by the Greek explorer Pytheas in the 4th century BC.[82] Seneca wrote about auroras in 
            the first book of his Naturales Quaestiones, classifying them, for instance, as pithaei ('barrel-like'); chasmata ('chasm'); pogoniae 
            ('bearded'); cyparissae ('like cypress trees'); and describing their manifold colours. He wrote about whether they were above or below 
            the clouds, and recalled that under Tiberius, an aurora formed above the port city of Ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort 
            of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue.[83] It has been suggested that Pliny the Elder depicted the aurora 
            borealis in his Natural History, when he refers to trabes, chasma, "falling red flames", and "daylight in the night".[84]

            The earliest depiction of the aurora may have been in Cro-Magnon cave paintings of northern Spain dating to 30,000 BC.[85]

            The oldest known written record of the aurora was in a Chinese legend written around 2600 BC. On an autumn around 2000 BC,[86] according 
            to a legend, a young woman named Fubao was sitting alone in the wilderness by a bay, when suddenly a "magical band of light" appeared like 
            "moving clouds and flowing water", turning into a bright halo around the Big Dipper, which cascaded a pale silver brilliance, illuminating 
            the earth and making shapes and shadows seem alive. Moved by this sight, Fubao became pregnant and gave birth to a son, the Emperor Xuanyuan, 
            known legendarily as the initiator of Chinese culture and the ancestor of all Chinese people.[citation needed] In the Shanhaijing, a creature 
            named Shilong is described to be like a red dragon shining in the night sky with a body a thousand miles long. In ancient times, the Chinese 
            did not have a fixed word for the aurora, so it was named according to the different shapes of the aurora, such as "Sky Dog" (天狗), 
            "Sword/Knife Star" (刀星), "Chiyou banner" (蚩尤旗), "Sky's Open Eyes" (天开眼), and "Stars like Rain" (星陨如雨).[citation needed]

            In Japanese folklore, pheasants were considered messengers from heaven. However, researchers from Japan's Graduate University for Advanced 
            Studies and National Institute of Polar Research claimed in March 2020 that red pheasant tails witnessed across the night sky over Japan 
            in 620 A.D., might be a red aurora produced during a magnetic storm.[87]


            The Aboriginal Australians associated auroras (which are mainly low on the horizon and predominantly red) with fire.
            In the traditions of Aboriginal Australians, the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the Gunditjmara 
            people of western Victoria called auroras puae buae ('ashes'), while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires 
            in the spirit world. The Dieri people of South Australia say that an auroral display is kootchee, an evil spirit creating a large fire. 
            Similarly, the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia refer to auroras seen over Kangaroo Island as the campfires of spirits in the 
            'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people[which?] in southwest Queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the Oola Pikka, ghostly 
            spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the
             messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.[88]

            Among the Māori people of New Zealand, aurora australis or Tahunui-a-rangi ("great torches in the sky") were lit by ancestors who 
            sailed south to a "land of ice" (or their descendants);[89][90] these people were said to be Ui-te-Rangiora's expedition party who 
            had reached the Southern Ocean.[89] around the 7th century.[91]


            Aurora pictured as wreath of rays in the coat of arms of Utsjoki
            In Scandinavia, the first mention of norðrljós (the northern lights) is found in the Norwegian chronicle Konungs Skuggsjá from AD 1230. 
            The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that 
            the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that glaciers could store 
            energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.[92]

            Walter William Bryant wrote in his book Kepler (1920) that Tycho Brahe "seems to have been something of a homœopathist, for he recommends 
            sulfur to cure infectious diseases 'brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis'".[93]

            In 1778, Benjamin Franklin theorized in his paper Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation 
            that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:[94][95][96]

            May not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condens'd there, and fall in snow,
            which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low 
            atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible 
            where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled 
            with the upper air?

            Observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of Uppsala by 
            Anders Celsius and Olof Hiorter. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuation to the observation of an aurora overhead. 
            This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.[97]


            Frederic Edwin Church's 1865 painting Aurora Borealis
            A variety of Native American myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer Samuel Hearne travelled with Chipewyan Dene in 1771 and 
            recorded their views on the ed-thin ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks 
            produced when caribou fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when 
            they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.[98]

            During the night after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this as a sign that 
            God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting Aurora Borealis by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted 
            to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.[99]

            A mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th century.[100] It quotes Halley as saying that before the 
            aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is 
            recorded in the Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences between 1666 and 1716; and that one aurora recorded in Berlin Miscellany for 
            1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at Bologna was stated to be the first ever seen there. Celsius (1733) states the oldest 
            residents of Uppsala thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 and 1715 corresponds to the Maunder 
            minimum in sunspot activity.

            In Robert W. Service's satirical poem "The Ballad of the Northern Lights" (1908), a Yukon prospector discovers that the aurora is the glow from 
            a radium mine. He stakes his claim, then goes to town looking for investors.

            In the early 1900s, the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland laid the foundation[colloquialism] for the current understanding of geomagnetism 
            and polar auroras.

            In Sami mythology, the northern lights are caused by the deceased who bled to death cutting themselves, their blood spilling on the sky. 
            Many aboriginal peoples of northern Eurasia and North America share similar beliefs of northern lights being the blood of the deceased, 
            some believing they are caused by dead warriors' blood spraying on the sky as they engage in playing games, riding horses or having fun in some other way.
